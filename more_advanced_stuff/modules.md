# Modules

1. What are modules? Why might you use modules? How do you access modules from
other classes?
2. What is the difference between `include` and `require`? Between `include`
and `extend`?
3. Create a module called `NumberTheory` which contains two methods: `is_even`
and `is_odd`. You should now be able to call methods like
`NumberTheory.even?(7)`. (Don't forget to include the module.)
4. Do some research on common Ruby modules. What problems do they solve?
