# Blocks

It may be worthwhile to review Ruby Bits, Level 6, before going through these
problems.

1. Learn how to use the Array's `.each` method (plus a block) to print all
elements of an array to the screen.
2. Learn how to use the Hash's `.each` method (plus a block) to print all
key/value pairs to the screen.
3. Create an array of integers. Iterate through that array (using the `.each`
method plus a block) and output only the integers that are even (Hint: use the
`%` operator).
4. Create an array of words. Iterate through the array using `.each` (and a
block), then print each of those words in UPPERCASE.
5. Create a hash representing a Driver's License (or some other short list of
information that fits within fields). Iterate through the hash using a `.each`
block and output the results so that the label for each data member (i.e. NAME
or ID) is all-caps but the information itself is represented as written.
6. Learn how to use `.select` with an array; create an array of integers, then
`.select` over it to create a new array of only the odd integers.
7. Do the same as the previous problem, but instead `.select` over an array of
words and return only the words that start with **A** or **a**. (You'll
probably need to use the String class's methods to figure out how to check the
value of a pre-determined character in a string.)
8. `.select` over a hash (that you design) to create a new hash whose elements
fulfill some condition.
