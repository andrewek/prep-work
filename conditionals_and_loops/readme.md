# 2. Control Flow, Decision Making, and Loops

Control flow and decision-making lets programs make decisions in ways that you
pre-determine. Loops let your program perform a single operation multiple times
(which makes your programs much more efficient). Between if-statements and
loops, you can now accomplish almost every single task you'll need to
accomplish (though you'll learn techniques later that make your life even
easier).

Before you begin these problems, go through these exercises and materials:

Way*](http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/ex27.html)
