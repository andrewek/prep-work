# Conditionals and Boolean Logic

As you work through these problems, try to draw a diagram of your logic flow
(through the if-statements and conditional trees).

1. Know how to use `if`, `elsif`, and `else` statements to create branching
boolean logic trees.
2. Know how to use `case` and `when` statements to create switches.
3. Write a program which prompts the user for a number, outputs "Valid" if the
number is positive, or "Invalid" if the number is less than or equal to zero.
4. Write a program which prompts the user for a number and outputs "Valid" if
the number is between 1 and 10 (inclusive) and "Invalid" otherwise.
5. Write a program which prompts the user for an integer and outputs whether
than integer is even or odd (hint: even numbers have a remainder of 0 when
divided by 2; odd numbers have a remainder of 1 when divided by 2)
6. Write a program which asks the user for 3 numbers and sorts them from least
to greatest using nothing but `if`, `elsif` and `else` statements. Output the
result.
7. Write a program which prompts the user for an all-caps string and which then
checks to see if that string is indeed all-caps.
8. Create a menu (perhaps for food or drinks?) which asks the user to input a
number corresponding to their choice of item, and which then prints "Delivering
[that item]." Use a `case` statement. Make sure to account for invalid inputs
using an `else`.
9. Learn how to use the ternary operator.
10. Learn how to use the `unless` keyword.
11. Prompt the user for a positive odd number (or a positive even number,
or...). Write a program that uses a nested if-statement to determine if the
user's input fulfills the conditions. Now write one that uses the logical
operators (`&&` and/or `||`) to do the same test, but in less time.
12. Write a program that prompts the user for a date with a month, date, and
year (all numerically expressed) and then verifies that this date exists (for
example: `7 28 2014` exists, but `22 34 1999` does not). Make sure to account
for leap years. This program is easiest if you prompt for the month, date, and
year separately.
13. For any triangle, the lengths of any two legs must be greater than the
length of the remaining leg. Write a program which prompts the user for the
lengths of the legs of a triangle, and which outputs whether that triangle is,
in fact, valid (i.e. whether it fulfills the requirement above). Consider
adding a test to see if the triangle is equilateral, isoscoles, or scalene, and
whether or not it is a right triangle (Hint: how would you determine which
sides should be the legs and which side should be the hypotenuse?).
14. Using `if`, `elsif`, and `else` blocks, write a program which allows two
users to each input their moves in "Rock, Paper, Scissors" and which determines
the winner (or if a tie occurred).
