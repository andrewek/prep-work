# 3. Data Structures Intro

*Data Structures* are basically just ways to store information in Ruby. There are lots and lots
of data structures, but the two you'll need to know for now are arrays and hashes, which are two
different ways to group together lots of pieces of information.

**Arrays**

- *Learn Ruby the Hard Way*, [Exercises 32-34 and
  38](http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/ex32.html)
- codecademy's ["Arrays and Hashes" course](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/ruby)
- Chapter 8 of Chris Pine's book.

**Hashes**

- codecademy's ["Arrays and Hashes" course](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/ruby)
- 12.3 of Chris Pine's book
- [Exercise 39](http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/ex39.html) of *Learn Ruby the Hard Way*

As you go through these problems, think about what you might use arrays for and what you might
use hashes for. Both arrays and hashes provide ways to group together information (how would
you solve these problems if you weren't allowed to use arrays or hashes?), so what sorts of
groupings make the most sense for each?
