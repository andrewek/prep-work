# Documentation

1. Learn how to write single-line comments (they start with `#`).
2. Learn how to write multi-line comments.
3. Look up the [Ruby Core Documentation](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.2/). Look through it,
but don't worry about understanding everything just yet. Bookmark this page; you'll need it.

Now that you know how to use code comments, start each of your exercises by copy/pasting the
problem text into the Repl.it window. That way, you have it for reference as you work, and it's
easy to figure out which problem your Repl.it links are for when you send them to us.
