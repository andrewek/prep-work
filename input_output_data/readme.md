# 1. Input, Output, Data Manipulation, and Math

This section will get you working with the basics of Ruby.

First, read through chapters 2-6 of Chris Pine's *[Learn to
Program](http://omahacodeschool.com/files/learn_to_program.pdf)*, then do the
[Introduction to Ruby course on this
page](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/ruby), then consider level one of *[Try
Ruby](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-ruby)*. You might also find some
joy in exercises 1-12 in *[Learn Ruby the Hard
Way](http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/)*.

By the end of this section, you should know how to collect input and do output,
plus a bit of math and data manipulation in-between. You'll also need to do
some independent research outside of the collected resources. (Remember, Google
is your friend.)
